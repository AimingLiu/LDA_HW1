1. Plasma inorganic phosphate measurements obtained from 13 control and 20 obese patients 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 hours after an oral glucose challenge. The investigators intend to test the following hypotheses using Hotelling’s *T*<sup>2</sup> statistic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  To test the null hypothesis that the group means are the same at all
    six measurement times. (b) To test whether the profiles in the two
    groups are parallel.
2.  To test whether the differences in means at 2 and 3 hours after an
    oral glucose challenge are different between the control and obese
    patients. Set up suitable model clearly stating the assumptions.
    Suggest appropriate contrast matrices for the hypothesis tests
    proposed by the investigators.

Set up the model as *Y* = *X**B* + *E* and also we assume \*
*y*<sub>*s*<sub>*i*</sub></sub> ∼ *M**V**N*(*μ*<sub>*s*<sub>*i*</sub></sub>, *Σ*)
each group has its own *μ*<sub>*s*<sub>*i*</sub></sub> *Σ* remains the
same across the groups And the hypothesis has the general form as
*A**B**C* = *D*.And

$$ 
B = \\begin{pmatrix}
  \\mu\_{11} & \\mu\_{12} & \\mu\_{13} & \\mu\_{14} & \\mu\_{15} & \\mu\_{16} \\\\
  \\mu\_{21} & \\mu\_{22} & \\mu\_{23} & \\mu\_{12} & \\mu\_{25} & \\mu\_{26} \\\\
\\end{pmatrix} \\\\
