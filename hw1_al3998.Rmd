# Part A


##  1. Plasma inorganic phosphate measurements obtained from 13 control and 20 obese patients 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 hours after an oral glucose challenge. The investigators intend to test the following hypotheses using Hotellingâ€™s $T^{2}$ statistic. 
(a) To test the null hypothesis that the group means are the same at all six measurement times. (b) To test whether the profiles in the two groups are parallel.
(c) To test whether the differences in means at 2 and 3 hours after an oral glucose challenge are different between the control and obese patients.
Set up suitable model clearly stating the assumptions. Suggest appropriate contrast matrices for the hypothesis tests proposed by the investigators.

Set up the model as $Y = XB + E$ and also we assume 
* $y_{s_{i}} \sim MVN(\mu_{s_{i}}, \Sigma)$
each group has its own $\mu_{s_{i}}$
$\Sigma$ remains the same across the groups
And the hypothesis has the general form as $ABC = D$.And

$$ 
B = \begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_{11} & \mu_{12} & \mu_{13} & \mu_{14} & \mu_{15} & \mu_{16} \\
  \mu_{21} & \mu_{22} & \mu_{23} & \mu_{12} & \mu_{25} & \mu_{26} \\
\end{pmatrix} \\
$$
